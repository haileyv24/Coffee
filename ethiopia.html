    <h2>Why Ethiopian Coffee?</h2>
    <p>
      You may have already heard that Ethiopia is the birthplace of coffee, where some of the best beans are grown. There is a guide to coffee from Ethiopia that tells the story of how an Ethiopian goat herder, Kaldi, was the first to discover coffee and its benefits as early as 850 AD, when he observed their energizing effects on his goats. Thanks to the high altitude growing conditions, the country is known to produce the best coffee in the world. The country is especially famous for its Harrar coffee, which is grown in the highlands of the Eastern part of Ethiopia on small farms. Harrar usually has a wine accent, with a little astringency. Depending on the growth conditions, it may also have a spicy or fruit flavor.
