    <h2>Why Colombian Coffee?</h2>
    <p>
        Arabica coffee beans are also grown in Colombia, making the country a giant in the coffee business, supplying 15% of the worldâ€™s coffee. Thanks to its excellent climate, perfect soil, and the exact right amount of sunlight and rainfall, Colombia is celebrated for producing some of the most superior beans with rich flavors.  Colombian producers are also famous for ensuring that their harvests are picked by hand, a process that guarantees telling the difference between green beans, unripe beans, overripe beans, and the ideal coffee cherry.

    <h2>How Much Does it Cost?</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee from Colombia would cost you around $15 for a 2 pound bag.
