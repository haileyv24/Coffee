    <h2>Why Costa Rican Coffee?</h2>
    <p>
        The coffee in Costa Rican is known to have a classic taste with an overall good reputation – this is mostly because the beans are well rounded on all fronts. Generally speaking, the country’s coffees are wet-processed Arabicas. It’s interesting to know that a law was passed in 1989 prohibiting the planting of low-quality beans in the country, encouraging Costa Rican farmers to seek true excellence. The plant of the Arabica coffee beans is very delicate, for it needs specific climate conditions to thrive, like high altitudes and mild temperatures. The coffee beans that grow on the volcanic soils of the mountainous regions of the country turn out to be smooth and soft, with a rich, walnut-like flavor.
