    <h2>Why Brazilian Coffee?</h2>
    <p>
        Brazil is the worldâ€™s largest coffee producer, responsible for a whole third of all the coffee we consume. The country is covered by over 10,000 square miles of coffee plantations, mostly located in the southeastern states where the environment is ideal for consistent conditions for coffee production. Because of the huge volumes of production, the country is not known for one specific strain. Brazil grows everything from mass produced cheap coffees (like lower grade Arabica), to sophisticated and elegant coffees. The climate, soil quality and altitude, usually which variety will grow best in which region. You can tell a good cup of Brazilian when your beverage is clear, sweet, medium-bodied, with low acidity.
