    <h2>Why Jamaican Coffee?</h2>
    <p>
        Jamaica is famous for producing one of the most expensive, premium coffees on the planet. Globally speaking, the country’s Blue Mountain coffee is one of the rare variants. It carries an exquisite taste that’s extremely well-balanced in flavor, with an excellent body, and a pleasant medium acidity (rare in coffees with such a nice body). It’s smooth, clean, sweet, and mild. This rare bean must be grown in the Blue Mountains on the eastern part of the island of Jamaica – in the parishes of Portland, St. Andrew, and St. Thomas – between 2,000 to 5,000 ft., and come from only five certified estates, which is a very limited area to grow. That’s why it’s very pricey to purchase, and is considered a luxury commodity.

    <h2>How Much Does it Cost?</h2>

      Coffee from Jamaica would cost you around $25 for a 2 pound bag.
