    <h2>Why Yemeni Coffee?</h2>
    <p>
        Arabian Mocha is one of the most famous coffees in the world, and has been cultivated and traded for centuries in the Arabian Peninsula. Around the 15th century, the beans were being grown in the Yemen district of Arabia, and by the 16th century, they were known in Persia, Egypt, Syria, and Turkey.  While the appearance of the coffee beans can scare away people, for theyâ€™re small, with an unstandardized shape, and are usually broken up, the Arabian Mocha is considered one of the most delicious coffees in the world, with a rich chocolatey flavor and subtle wine notes. Due to the small production volumes, the Arabian Mocha is hardly ever exported.

    <h2>How Much Does it Cost?</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee from Yemen would cost you around $35 for a 1 pound bag.
